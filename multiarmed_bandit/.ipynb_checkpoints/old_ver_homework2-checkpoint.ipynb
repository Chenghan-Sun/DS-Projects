    "The multi-armed bandit framework assumes that you are in a two player game where you select a number from 1 to K (we call this number the arm that you pulled).  Then the other player selects a reward, $r_{i,t}$ based on the arm, $i$, at time $t$ that you selected and reveals that to you.  Your job is to come up with a policy which determines which arm to pull at a given time based on the past performances of the arms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name multi-armed bandit comes from the gambling world, in which a slot machine is called a one armed bandit.  In that setting, you pull the arm and recieve some reward.  In this fictional setting there are multiple arms for the slot machine, each paying out different rewards.  Because you can only pull one at a time, you only see the reward from the arm you pulled.  This partial observability puts you in the challenging position of needing to explore the arms, seeing which has better performance, before you start to exploit the best arm.  Below is a simulation from a simple mult-armed bandit."
